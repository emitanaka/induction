# Expectations

A common misconception is that a supervisor drives your research or explains what you do. The term "supervisor" probably doesn't help and the term "advisor" used in US more aligns with what is expected from a supervisor. This means that supervisor is there to provide you *guidance* but the person who drives the research and the work is *you*.

## Knowledge

I expect that you know `R` and some statistical modelling. Great if you know how to use R-Markdown and LaTeX; if not it is expected that you learn quickly. 

# Requirements

It is expected that you have your own computer with admin access. If you do not and would like one supplied to you, please contact our Computer Systems Manager, Paul Szabo, (paul.szabo@sydney.edu.au).

You should have:

* Latest [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 
* Latest [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

You will need additional R packages including (but not limited to): `tidyverse` (or `ggplot2` and `dplyr`), `agridat`, `lme4`, and `rmarkdown`.
